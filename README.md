# Simultaneously Transmitting and Reflecting Surface (STARS) for Terahertz Communications

The code for the papers 

**Z. Wang, X. Mu, J. Xu, and Y. Liu, “Simultaneously Transmitting and Reflecting Surface (STARS) for Terahertz Communications,” *IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing*, Early Access, May 2023.** [[IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10133914)] [[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00497)]

*Note*: In this repository, we only provide the codes for the STARS with independent phase shifts. The codes can be modified to the cases of coupled phase-shift STARS based on [[1](https://github.com/zhaolin820/coupled-phase-shift-STAR-RIS)].


## Running the simulations

### Prerequisites

- [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/)

### Instructions
The codes are organized in two folders:

- `narrowband` contains the codes for narrowband systems
- `wideband` contains the codes for wideband systems

Run `main.m` to get the results
